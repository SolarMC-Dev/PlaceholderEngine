/**
 * Adds additional tokens when a certain token is added. <br>
 * <br>
 * When a {@link Placeholder} adds a token to the {@link TokenOutput}, available
 * instances of this interface are then used to provide further tokens. This is intended
 * to allow certain tokens to imply other tokens. <br>
 * <br>
 * For example, a subclass token value may imply a superclass token value is also available.
 * See {@link SuperclassTokenExtrapolator} as an implementation of this example. <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Implementing this interface for types outside your namespace</b> <br>
 * In general, to determine whose responsibility it may be to add a token extrapolator for
 * a type, whichever party is responsible for that type's namespace is also responsible fo
 * adding the token extrapolator. <br>
 * <br>
 * Otherwise, any party may implement the token extrapolator. <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Discovery of implementations</b> <br>
 * Instances of this interface are loaded via the {@link ServiceLoader}. Additionally,
 * they may be manually added using {@link PlaceholderEngine#addTokenExtrapolator}
